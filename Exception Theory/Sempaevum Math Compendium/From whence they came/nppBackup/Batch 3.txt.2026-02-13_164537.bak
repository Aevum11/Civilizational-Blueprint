BATCH 3

====================

## Part IX: PDT = EIM (Trinary Ternary Logic)

### The Identity

**PDT = EIM so 3=3**

The fundamental structure (Point, Descriptor, Traverser) generates the experiential structure (Exception, Incoherence, Mediation).

They are the same reality viewed from different perspectives.

### The Mapping

**P (Point)** → **E (Exception)**: The grounded, substantiated Point creates the Exception
**D (Descriptor)** → **I (Incoherence)**: Descriptors define what's possible vs impossible (coherent vs incoherent)
**T (Traverser)** → **M (Mediation)**: Traversers mediate between configurations, creating the binding/interaction

### Trinary Ternary Logic

This is **Trinary** (three categories) and **Ternary** (three-valued):

**Three Categories**: P, D, T (or E, I, M)
**Three Values**:
- Infinite (P)
- Finite (D)
- Indeterminate (T)

**Three States**:
- Unsubstantiated (potential)
- Substantiated (actual)
- Incoherent (impossible)

The number three appears at every level because it's the minimum structure for a complete system:
- Two categories create duality (subject/object, wave/particle) - incomplete
- Three categories create stable relationalism (substrate/constraint/agency) - complete
- Four or more would be redundant - reducible to three

### Why 3 = 3

This is not numerical equality. This is **categorical equivalence**.

PDT (ontological primitives) and EIM (experiential structures) are two ways of describing the same reality:
- PDT from the "outside" (structural view)
- EIM from the "inside" (phenomenological view)

They are isomorphic - one-to-one correspondence preserving all relationships.
