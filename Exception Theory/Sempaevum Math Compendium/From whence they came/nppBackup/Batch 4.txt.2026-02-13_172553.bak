====================

1. Complex Numbers and Orthogonal Descriptors

#### What is i = √(-1)?

**Standard mathematics**: Imaginary unit, orthogonal to reals

**ET interpretation:**

Real numbers = one descriptor axis
Imaginary numbers = orthogonal descriptor axis

$$z = a + bi$$

Is:
- Point with two descriptor dimensions
- Real part (a) = D₁ (one constraint)
- Imaginary part (b) = D₂ (orthogonal constraint)

**Complex plane = 2D descriptor space**

#### Why does i² = -1?

Because rotating 90° in descriptor space twice = 180° rotation = negation.

**This is geometric necessity in 2D descriptor manifold.**

Multiplication by i rotates vectors 90° in the complex plane. Two rotations (i²) yield 180° = reversal of direction = multiplication by -1.

This isn't convention—it's the inherent geometry of orthogonal descriptor axes.
