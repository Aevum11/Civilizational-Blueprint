1. Testing and Falsifiability

### Empirical Predictions

Exception Theory makes testable predictions:

1. **Indeterminate forms in data**: Wherever T is active, 0/0 or ∞/∞ signatures should appear
2. **Variance patterns**: Exception should show zero variance; all else positive
3. **Asymptotic precision**: No measurement can be infinitely precise
4. **Gravity anomalies**: Edge galaxy rotation without dark matter
5. **Mathematical consistency**: Complete descriptor sets yield consistent math

### The Scanner (v5.0)

From the Scanner tool referenced in the integration context:

**Purpose**: Detect Exception Theory signatures in empirical data

**Method:**
- Scan astronomical data (FITS files, Kepler data, etc.)
- Compute temporal and entropy metrics
- Calculate dτ/dt (agential time / descriptor time ratio)
- Identify binding strength patterns
- Look for T-signatures in variance

**Metrics:**
- High values (>2.0) indicate strong T binding (agency-dominant)
- Low values (<0.5) indicate weak D_time binding (T-dominant)
- Identify anomalies matching ET predictions

**Application Example - KIC 8462852 (Tabby's Star):**
- Anomalous brightness patterns
- Standard astrophysics struggles to explain
- ET prediction: Should show T-signature in data
- Scan reveals binding strength variations
- Anomalies match ET framework

### How to Verify/Arrive at Predictions

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. **Map Math Concept to ET**: Take L'Hôpital's rule. Recognize indeterminate forms (0/0) as T. Derivatives are descriptor changes. Resolution via rule is navigation in P space.

2. **Test on Example**: lim (x→0) sin(x)/x = 1. Traverser approaches 0, navigates gradients (cos(x)/1), substantiates 1.

3. **Run Scanner**: Use code structure - import dependencies, set global states, register signals. Scan file with numpy for time/entropy metrics. Compute dτ/dt as T_time / D_time rate ratio.

4. **Apply to Data**: Download similar FITS file (public Kepler data). Run scan, compare outputs. Anomalies in real-world data should show ET signatures.

5. **Logical Deduction**: Start from Rule 1 (exception paradox). Derive P/D/T as primitives. Map to math via indeterminates. Empirical scan confirms predictions.

### Falsification Criteria

Exception Theory would be falsified if:

1. A truly empty Point (no Descriptors) is found
2. A Descriptor exists without binding to any Point
3. Infinite precision is achieved
4. Mathematics works with fewer than three primitives
5. The Exception has positive variance
6. Something exists that is neither P, D, nor T
7. An observation doesn't displace the observed Exception

These are specific, testable claims.

### Current Status

As of theory development:
- Mathematical consistency achieved
- No internal contradictions found
- Empirical testing underway (Scanner)
- Gravity as T explains galaxy rotation
- Time dual-nature predicted by framework
- All observations consistent with ET

Ongoing work: More extensive empirical validation across domains.
