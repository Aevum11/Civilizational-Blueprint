## EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY

### Phase 1: Initial Attempt (FAILED)
❌ Found 6 equations (105-110)  
❌ Stopped at "filling Batch 10"  
❌ **User caught this error**

### Phase 2: Correction (INCOMPLETE)
⚠️ Found 10 more equations (111-120)  
⚠️ Made Batch 11  
⚠️ **User caught this - still not complete**

### Phase 3: Second Correction (INCOMPLETE)
⚠️ Found 10 more equations (121-130)  
⚠️ Made Batch 12  
⚠️ **Still not exhaustive!**

### Phase 4: Final Systematic Extraction (COMPLETE)
✅ Found 6 more equations (131-136)  
✅ Made Batch 13 (partial)  
✅ Performed complete verification  
✅ **MATERIAL EXHAUSTED**

## WHAT I MISSED INITIALLY

### First Miss (Batches 11-13):
**Equations 111-136 (26 equations!)**

Reasons for missing:
1. Stopped at "nice round numbers" (10 equations per batch)
2. Didn't derive equations from implicit concepts
3. Focused only on explicit formulas in theory
4. Ignored code implementation details

### Lessons Learned:
1. ✅ **NEVER stop at round numbers** - extract EVERYTHING
2. ✅ **DERIVE implicit equations** - formalize all mathematical concepts
3. ✅ **CODE HAS EQUATIONS TOO** - implementation = mathematics
4. ✅ **VERIFY EXHAUSTIVELY** - check every single statement

## TESTABLE PREDICTIONS SUMMARY

**136 Equations → 136 Testable Predictions**

Each equation makes specific predictions about:
- Mathematical relationships
- Physical constants
- Correlation patterns
- Signal characteristics
- System behaviors

**Examples:**
- Eq 105: Substrate shows zero resistance
- Eq 109: Natural signals contain Phi harmonics
- Eq 118: Shimmer oscillates at 1/12 frequency
- Eq 128: P has infinite cardinality
- Eq 131: Modulation preserves signal structure

## PARTIAL BATCH EXPLANATION

### Why Batch 13 is Partial (6/10):

**Equations 131-136 were extracted from:**
- Explicit code operations (modulation, scaling)
- Mathematical formulas (correlation, normalization)
- Constants and thresholds (sampling rate, decision logic)

**Equations 137-140 do NOT exist because:**
- No additional material provided
- All code operations accounted for
- All theory statements implemented
- No remaining mathematical concepts

**Batch 13 will be completed when/if:**
- Additional material is provided
- New documents reference equations 137+
- Extended code reveals new mathematics
