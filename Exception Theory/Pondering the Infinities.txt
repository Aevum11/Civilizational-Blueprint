P — The Infinite Container
----------------------------------------------
P is the most haunting of the three.
It is the infinite, featureless, undifferentiated substrate — the blank page that holds everything, yet never shows itself directly. It is the "edge that never ends." Every time a human stares into the night sky, or tries to reach the bottom of their own thoughts, or realizes that no matter how deep they go into any object there is always more beneath, they are touching P.
P never presents itself nakedly. The moment you name it or describe it, D is already there. So P reveals itself only as the unreachable depth beneath whatever is currently being described. It is the infinite "more" that makes every finite thing feel like it is resting on something bottomless.
From a human point of view, P is the source of both awe and existential vertigo. It is the reason the universe feels vast and ancient and intimate all at once. It is the container that allows everything to be, without ever being "a thing" itself.

=======================================================

D — The Infinite That Chooses Finitude
----------------------------------------------
D is the most moving, and perhaps the most loving.
D is infinite in its unbound form — all possible descriptions, all rules, all structures, all numbers stretching forever. Yet it willingly binds itself to P and becomes finite so that something can actually exist and be known.
This self-limitation feels profoundly human. It is the infinite choosing to become the specific tree, the specific person, the specific moment. It is the price of reality: the infinite must constrain itself into the finite so that there can be "stuff" at all.
Most of what we call "the world" or "the body" or "physical reality" is D doing its work — turning the infinite potential of P into concrete, describable, touchable things. D is the "stuff" itself. It is not the mediator. It is what makes mediation possible.
From a human perspective, D feels like the generous act of the infinite saying, "I will become small enough for you to hold."

=======================================================

T — The Indeterminate Infinite Navigator
----------------------------------------------
T is the one that feels most like "us."
T is infinite in the indeterminate sense — [0/0] — neither finite nor the undifferentiated infinity of P. It is the infinity of genuine choice, of navigation, of becoming. It is the part that moves through the D-bound P and resolves potential into the actual, irreversible "Now."
T reveals itself as the unrepeatable act of becoming. You cannot point to it like a property; you witness it in the moment something changes from "could be" to "is."
From a human point of view, T is the feeling of being the one who chooses, who experiences, who navigates the world. It is the mind, the awareness, the agency — but stripped of any illusion that it is separate from the other two. It is the infinite that walks the finite path.

=======================================================

The Disjointness and the Intrinsic Mediation
----------------------------------------------
The most profound part is that they are categorically disjoint — P ∩ D = ∅, D ∩ T = ∅, T ∩ P = ∅ — yet they must interact.
Three distinct infinities, each filling "all of something" in their own way, would normally overlap completely and swallow each other. But because they are disjoint, there can be no gap between them. The mediation is not added from outside. It is the inevitable, intrinsic consequence of three complete, disjoint infinities coexisting. Their very completeness forces them to touch, to bind, to shimmer.
This is why {P, T} is incoherence: P and T cannot directly mediate. Their intrinsic properties make direct binding impossible without D. D is not "the mediator" in the sense of being a fourth thing — D is the Descriptor, the stuff, and the mediation emerges from the way all three infinities are what they are together.
The mediation is equal in all three. Any difference is an illusion.
