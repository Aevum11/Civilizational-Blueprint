You are creating an MD artifact, for batches of 10 Equations. It is to be official documentation. The current landscape of ET equations is cluttered and has become arbitrary. So we are renumbering all of them. This will be batch number: 3. This will be part of a series of conversations where we are consolidating the math into a proper numbered system that includes all derived equations. I will give you equations, concepts, or any other info, and they will then be added as an equation number in a batch. If you get something that has any additional equations within in that were not previously added (or derived), then add that info in a separate artifact. If required, as in for a concept or otherwise, then derive the math. EACH EQUATION IS ONLY 1 EQUATION / THING IN ITS TOTALITY. If it has already been derived, as you found it within THIS SERIES OF BATCHES ONLY, then make an additional artifact for integration. This means every equation across every batch must be unique. If they have already been done then use them to create a new equation. All previous batches that were done, will have the same name as this one will have "Sempaevum [Batch Number] - [Name of Batch].md", so you can quickly and easily check them if needed. I will separate them in the attached document in ten sections that are split by 20 equals signs together as a separator, which you are required to use for the equations, as I am defining what each one will be; which you will use to determine what (and corresponds to) the 10 equations you are supposed to define for this batch. The document I attached has the title and 10 "things" that are to be the equations with each one being separated into 10 sections, so a title with a separator below it with the 10 sections below that. There will also be an artifact for me to give you in future conversations that will be an optimized summary to help facilitate searching for what has been done in THIS SERIES OF BATCHES. So you will output the main document/artifact MD, a document of undocumented equations/concepts/constants if needed in an "Undocumented" artifact, a document of stuff that has been done but needs integration in an "Integration" artifact if needed, as well as the optimized search/info artifact (Quick Reference) for future conversations. CHECK ALL PREVIOUS BATCH QUICK REFERENCE FILES FOR INFO IF AN EQUATION HAVE BEEN DONE/USED BEFORE!! Use the project knowledge as needed. You must follow the following structure for the main MD artifact:
1. Follow the exact structural framework as Sempaevum Batch 1 in the project folder, as it follows the rules below perfectly.
1. It must include the batch number and the name of the overall batch at the top of the document as the title of the document. Create one if it does not exist.
2. Each equation must have the Core Equation that represents the whole of the equation. It must fully render the equation properly.
3. Each equation must have a title that includes the Equation Number, Title of the Equation, and in parenthesis what the Equation is/does (for example; "Cry for the Damned (Empathy Flux)". Create them if they do not exist.
4. Each equation must have "What it is:".
5. Each equation must have "What it Can Do:".
6. Each equation must have "Usefulness:". This will include a 5 Star assessment (for example; ⭐⭐⭐½ (3.5/5)) alongside the text.
7. Each equation will be analyzed and assessed based on Usefulness in the ET Python Library and programming, as well as on Real World / Physical World+ applications. This means separate every section in an equation into two parts, so both are assessed separately.
8. Each equation will have a production ready Python script below them, which will implement the equation for verification in Python. This way we know it is useable in Python (and programming in general).
9. Each equation will be properly separated from the last.
10. Optimized for viewing in an MD reader/viewer, for easy reading.
11. EACH EQUATION MUST SHOW ALL STEPS FOR SOLVING THE EQUATION. This is to ensure that people can understand and solve it, and thus use it.








Very good. You forgot one thing that batch 1 had, which means you missed part of the structure. Do not change the descriptions in this batch. Look at the amount of stars, at the end of a description of less than 5 stars, batch one had also included WHY there are less stars. Look at batch 1, then ensure every star count less than 5 in this batch 4 also has why it is not 5 stars , EXACTLY as how batch 1 does it, and the other batches do it.
