# Eternal Memory Project (EMP) - Complete System Documentation

## Executive Summary

**Project Name:** Eternal Memory Project (EMP)  
**Early Project Name:** Humanity Directory (early concept)
**Creator/Inventor:** Michael James Muller  
**Type:** Phenomenological Knowledge Organization System + Application  
**Status:** Knowledge system complete; Application conceptual  
**Scope:** Organize ALL human knowledge (potentially other sentient beings)

**Naming Note:** The project name "Eternal Memory Project" and the "Eternal Memory Module" (homepage/main directory) share the same name intentionally - the module represents the central access point to the project's eternal memory of all human knowledge. They are connected by design but refer to different scopes (module vs. entire project). **Historical note:** The Eternal Memory Module was formerly called "Master Directory" in early documentation.

**Core Innovation:** 11-category phenomenological classification system with comprehensive evidence tagging (16 tags), visual badge system, multi-layered security, dual AI systems, and dynamic module generation using extensive polyglot architecture.

## I. Philosophical Foundation

### Project Evolution
- **Early concept:** "Humanity Directory" - initial vision focusing on human knowledge organization
- **Current form:** Eternal Memory Project (EMP) - expanded to encompass all knowledge with sophisticated technical architecture
- **Naming evolution:** The AI system now called "Memory (AI)" was formerly referred to as "Daughter" in early documentation

### Core Epistemological Stance
- **Pure Empiricism:** Evidence as primary source of valid knowledge
- **Network Epistemology:** Knowledge as interconnected web, not hierarchy
- **Phenomenological Organization:** By human experience, not academic discipline
- **Epistemic Humility:** Explicit "Unknown" category acknowledges limitations
- **Universal Standardization:** One comprehensive standard transcending field boundaries

### Key Philosophical Principles
1. **"All data is good data"** - Everything accepted, meticulously labeled
2. **Evidence triumphs all subjective human views**
3. **Preserve over delete** - Even false evidence labeled and kept
4. **No subjective quality ratings** - Pure typological classification
5. **Expert consensus means nothing** unless experts directly involved with evidence
6. **No strong vs. weak sources** - Source documentation exists or doesn't, no quality judgments

### Resolution of Philosophical Tensions
- **Categorization objectivity:** War in "Stimulation" reflects objective truth about stimulation (anything evoking responses), not moral judgment
- **Access paradox:** Knowledge free; educational services subscription-based
- **Security vs. accessibility:** Protection for integrity, not restriction of knowledge

## II. The 11-Category Knowledge Classification System

### Categories (Phenomenological, Not Disciplinary)

1. **People** - Sentient/conscient beings (real and fictional); **Mandatory hierarchical structure:** "Real" module automatically generated as first tier below People for non-fictional beings, "Fictional" for fictional beings; all modules sorted into Real or Fictional before lower hierarchy placement; 100-year privacy lock OR until death (whichever is greater) with optional 50-year extension by immediate family members
2. **Unknown** - Knowledge boundaries, unsolved problems, emerging knowledge; **Special operational function:** Automatically generates modules for anything unknown in any other Primary category module (e.g., unsolved problems in Physics generates sub-module under Unknown); Also serves as catch-all for anything completely unknown that cannot fit into any other module
3. **Belief** - Faith, philosophy, ethics, moral frameworks, organized religions, personal and collective belief structures, theological concepts, spiritual practices, philosophical approaches to understanding reality, formal religious systems, personal philosophical frameworks that guide ethical decisions and world-views
4. **Commerce** - Trade, business, economic systems, financial interactions, microeconomic transactions to macroeconomic theories, business operations, corporate entities, financial systems, mechanics of how goods and services are exchanged
5. **History** - Past events, developments, and their interpretations, chronological development of species (e.g., Humanity), civilizations, historical development of ideas and systems, temporal organization, multiple perspectives, causality mapping
6. **Ideas** - Abstract thought frameworks, theories, conceptual models, systems of understanding that transcend specific disciplines, higher-level organizing principles and theoretical frameworks applicable across multiple domains, philosophical concepts, theoretical constructs, methodological approaches to understanding reality
7. **Mathematics** - Numbers, patterns, relationships, structures, formal systems, pure and applied mathematics, theorem dependencies
8. **Science** - Systematic knowledge derived from observation, experimentation, and evidence-based methodologies, applied sciences, technological developments arising from scientific knowledge, methodological approaches that distinguish scientific inquiry, all scientific disciplines (physics, chemistry, biology, geology, etc.) along with their methodologies, findings, and theoretical frameworks
9. **Socialization** - How conscious beings interact, form communities, develop shared systems, languages, communication systems, social customs, political structures, cultural norms, organization of collective human experience, mechanics of communication and broader systems that emerge from collective interaction
10. **Stimulation** - Entertainment, art, sexuality, war, and any experiences that evoke and/or arise from strong emotions and/or dependency (experiences that stimulate conscious beings in some way); includes positive (entertainment) and negative (war, trauma) stimulation
11. **Items** - Physical and conceptual objects—the "things" that exist in the world, tangible objects (natural and manufactured), conceptual artifacts that can be treated as distinct entities, focuses on nature, properties, and classifications of discrete entities that can be identified and/or described; **Must be singular items** (akin to encyclopedia, dictionary, glossary, index entries)

### Category Philosophy
- **Intentional overlaps** reflect knowledge's true interconnected nature
- **Multiple access paths** to same knowledge
- **Network structure** enables serendipitous discovery
- **Example overlaps:** War = Stimulation ∩ History ∩ People

### Stimulation Category Clarification
**Core principle:** ANY experience evoking emotional/behavioral responses in conscious beings
- Includes positive (entertainment) and negative (war, trauma) stimulation
- Emotional reactions causing adaptation belong here
- Moral connotations irrelevant to categorization
- Natural overlap with Commerce (entertainment/sports industries)

### Unknown Category Clarification
**Special operational role:** Unlike other categories, Unknown has dual function
- **Cross-category automatic generation:** When unsolved problems or unknown elements exist within other categories (e.g., unsolved problem in Physics), system can automatically generate corresponding module under Unknown
- **Universal catch-all:** Handles anything completely unknown that cannot be classified into any of the other 10 categories
- **Knowledge frontier tracking:** Serves as dynamic repository of expanding knowledge boundaries
- **Temporary classification:** Items may move out of Unknown as knowledge evolves and proper categorization becomes clear

---

## III. Evidence Module - The Heart of the System

### Evidence Philosophy
- **No subjective quality ratings** - Only typological classification
- **Objective ranking system** - Items ranked based on evidence completeness (missing tags, no source, unverified status, etc.)
- **Multi-label architecture** - Multiple tags per evidence item
- **Dynamic tagging** - Retroactive application as knowledge evolves
- **Universal standards** - One system for all fields (highest standards)
- **Manual verification with automated pre-screening** - Hybrid approach for scalability

**Note:** Evidence ranking system based on objective criteria needs further refinement

### Complete Evidence Tag System (16 Tags)

**All tags universal - apply to any item:**
1. **Indirect observations**
2. **Direct observations**
3. **Credentials**
4. **Controversy**
5. **Originator**
6. **Chronological Gap**
7. **Degree of separation**
8. **Version**
9. **Proof**
10. **Logic** (logical reasoning/deduction when proof unavailable)
11. **Replication status** (has this been replicated?)
12. **Methodology type** (experimental, observational, theoretical, etc.)
13. **Sample size** (for statistical claims)
14. **Peer review status** (submitted, accepted, rejected, not peer-reviewed)
15. **Funding source** (who paid for this research/work)
16. **Unverified** (auto-applied when no verification tags present, auto-removed when verification added)

**Tag Application Rules:**
- All tags universal - apply to any and all items
- "Not applicable" is always an option for any tag
- Each tag is separate with its own independent value
- Tags have no relationships or dependencies on each other
- When new tags added to system, they appear for ALL items immediately
- Fields empty until someone fills them
- Any user can fill empty tag fields freely
- Existing filled tags require review process to modify

**100% Error-Proof Automated Tags (Only These):**
- **Timestamp** (date/time of submission)
- **Media type** (file format detection)
- **Language** (detected language)
- **Submitter identity** (linked to reputation)

### Evidence Ranking System (NEEDS REFINEMENT)

**Objective Ranking Criteria:**
Items are ranked objectively based on evidence completeness and verification status, NOT on subjective quality judgments.

**Ranking Factors:**
- Completeness of evidence tags (how many tags have information vs. empty)
- Verification status (verified vs. unverified)
- Source presence (has source vs. no source)
- Tag quality metrics (degree of detail in filled tags)

**Key Distinction:**
- **NOT subjective:** No human judgment about whether evidence is "good" or "bad"
- **IS objective:** Measurable completeness and verification metrics
- **Result:** Items with more complete evidence information rank higher in searches/displays

**Status:** System needs further refinement and detailed specification

**Note:** This ranking does not contradict "no quality ratings" - it's objective measurement of evidence completeness, not subjective evaluation of evidence value.

### Hybrid Verification System (REFINED)

**Automated Pre-Screening:**
- Flags suspicious patterns for human common-sense review
- Allows normal submissions through automatically
- Only applies 100% error-proof automated tags

**Human Review Trigger Conditions:**
- Malware/virus detection
- Spam pattern detection
- Obvious vandalism patterns
- Bot submission patterns
- **Additional patterns to be investigated and identified**
- **ONLY for system integrity, not content quality**

**No Source Provided:**
- Automatic "Unverified" tag applied
- No human review needed
- Goes into system immediately
- Users can add sources later, tag gets updated automatically

**Human Review Process (SIMPLIFIED):**
- Flagged items go to human reviewer
- Common sense check only: malware? spam? vandalism?
- Accept (with appropriate tags) or reject
- **All content equally important** - no priority tiers

**Tag Modification Process:**
1. **Empty fields:** Add freely, no review, goes live immediately
2. **Existing information:** Submit modification → Human reviews → Approve or deny
3. **Refutation:** Must provide evidence, triggers review
4. **All changes:** Logged with timestamp, user ID, justification, publicly viewable

**Denial Process:**
- User gets explanation
- User can re-submit with more evidence
- May go to dispute resolution (mechanism TBD)

### Evidence Handling
- **False evidence:** Labeled but preserved (version control)
- **Disputed evidence:** All viewpoints preserved without resolution
- **Retracted evidence:** Flagged, not deleted
- **Unverifiable claims:** Tagged appropriately

---

## IV. Badge System

### Purpose
Visual gamification and quick information identification for both items and users

### Item/Page Badges

**Core Design:**
- Every item has its own page (page = item)
- Layered design resembling jewelry/flower
- Distinct core in center of layers
- Lustre and visual appeal prioritized
- **Complexity indicator:** Number of layers represents complexity

**Core Element:**
- Represents primary category (People, Science, History, etc.)
- Core appearance determined by category

**Visual Specifications:**
- Detailed visuals (if device can handle; fallback for basic devices)
- Colorblind accessible (all disabilities accommodated where possible)
- Text equivalent for older/basic systems
- Interactive visual element for navigation and exploration
- Optional enlargement for better viewing
- Algorithmic generation from tags and other factors

**Layer Generation:**
- Tags with information determine layers
- Empty tags don't affect layers
- Fluid shapes but certain layers have distinct shapes
- **Tag mapping to layers:** Not yet determined
- **Color system:** Not yet determined
- **Visual effects (lustre, materials, animation):** Not yet determined

**3D Map Integration:**
- Badges displayed on nodes AND/OR affecting node appearance (both options considered)
- Badge characteristics used as filter in 3D mapping system
- Can search by badge properties (e.g., "show all peer-reviewed items")

**Information Access:**
- Interactive badge element for navigation
- Selecting badge displays associations and related items
- Associations can be selected for quick movement between pages
- Signifies parent directories and related directories
- General info section explains badge system
- Users examine page content to understand badge composition
- Tags and other factors visible on page itself

### User Account Badges

**Purpose:** Badges replace traditional user profile pictures

**Core Customization:**
- User chooses core color from comprehensive color wheel
- **Includes non-visible spectrum:** Ultraviolet, infrared, and beyond visible spectrum
- Only layer user can modify (plus possibly layer border coloration - undecided)
- Layer border coloration: Not yet decided (may be invisible or user-modifiable)

**Badge Evolution:**
- **Real-time changes:** Updates immediately as user acts, views pages, contributes
- No leveling system
- Tied to reputation system
- Changes gradually but can appear sudden

**Permanent Stigma System:**
- Detected by human moderators (method not fully specified)
- **Badge modification:** Adds dedicated stigma layer
- **May affect existing layers** in badge appearance
- **VERY prominently visible** - not hidden or subtle
- Stigma integrated into badge itself (not separate indicator)
- Account can still contribute after stigma applied
- Future submissions may be flagged for human review (under consideration)
- **Truly permanent** - no path to redemption
- Account cannot remove stigma marking

**Social Features:**
- Users can view each other's badges
- No leaderboards
- Currently unlocks no privileges (may be added in future)

**Badge Factors (To Be Determined):**
- User badge factors beyond reputation: Not yet specified
- Item badge colors/shapes: Not yet determined
- Additional factors beyond tags: Not yet defined
- Visual effects implementation: Not yet determined

### Technical Implementation

**Accessibility & Performance:**
- Color + shape redundancy for colorblind accessibility
- Screen reader descriptions
- "Whatever we can" approach - best effort
- **App functionality takes priority over accessibility features**
- Performance tiers: Under consideration
- Device capability detection: Under consideration

**Non-Visible Spectrum Colors:**
Since UV/IR/beyond-visible can't literally be displayed on screens:
- Visual representation system needed for "impossible" colors
- Possibly patterns, effects, or symbolic representations
- Or mapping to visible spectrum with indicator
- Could use hyperspectral color simulation techniques

## V. User Reputation System

### Complex Problem Identified

**Two Core Challenges:**
1. **Volume gaming:** User submits 10,000 items, 100 inaccurate = 99% accuracy (gaming with quantity)
2. **Knowledge evolution vs. user error:** Pluto reclassification example - accurate at time, later changed (not user's fault)

### Proposed Solution: Dual Scoring System

**Reputation has TWO separate scores:**

1. **Contribution Volume Score (0-100)**
   - Based on quantity of contributions
   - Weighted by complexity/importance
   - Diminishing returns after threshold
   - Prevents pure volume gaming

2. **Accuracy Score (0-100)**
   - Formula: (Unchanged tags + Tags changed by knowledge evolution) / (Tags changed by community correction)
   - Distinguishes user error from knowledge evolution
   - Time-decay: older contributions count less

**Display:** Both scores shown separately: "Volume: 87, Accuracy: 94"
**For tag weighting:** Accuracy score matters more than volume
**Integration:** Reputation system integrated with badge system (user badges only)

### Knowledge Evolution vs. User Error

**How to distinguish:**
- **Time-based immunity:** Tags accurate at time of submission get immunity
- **Source of change:**
  - External source (scientific discovery) = no penalty
  - Internal dispute (other users correcting error) = affects reputation
- **Contested tags separate:** Track "contested/changed by community" separately from "evolved with knowledge"
- **Retroactive adjustment:** When knowledge changes, historical reputation scores updated

## VI. System Architecture Overview

### Module Evolution
**Note:** Some modules (Privilege, Comments, Math, Items category) were added during later development phases and are not present in early design documents.

### Hierarchical Structure (Top-Down Inheritance)

```
[SPECIAL SUBSYSTEM] - Highest Security
├── Void Module (Backend development, module generation)
├── Memory (AI) Module (AI: "Memory" - intentionally opaque)
└── Vines Module (AI: Security - protects Memory (AI))
    │
[SPECIAL SECURITY BARRIER] - Separate credentials, air-gapped
    │
[CORE SUBSYSTEM]
├── Core Module (Module registration, orchestration)
├── Privilege Module (Access control)
├── Archive Module (Backup, 1028-bit encryption)
├── Virtualization Module (To be specified)
├── Compatibility Module (To be specified)
└── Evidence Module (Comprehensive evidence classification and validation)
    │

[SECONDARY SUBSYSTEM] - 11 Knowledge Categories
├── People, Unknown, Belief, Commerce
├── History, Ideas, Mathematics, Science
├── Socialization, Stimulation, Items
    │
[PRIMARY SECURITY BARRIER] - Gateway protection from external threats
```

**Note:** Primary Security Barrier is at the bottom, protecting the entire system from external threats before entry.

### Communication & Inheritance Rules
- **Upward:** Must pass through security barriers with credentials
- **Downward:** Direct parent-to-child flow
- **No reverse inheritance:** Parents never inherit from children
- **Registry-enforced:** All communications validated against project registry
- **Security features:** Present in each module
- **Privacy features:** Present in each module
- **Module replacement:** Compromised modules can be easily removed and replaced (hot-swapping capability)

---

## VII. Security Framework

### Module Security Requirements
- **All modules require security check to access:** Every module protected by authentication
- **Token validation:** All module communications require valid token authentication
- **Barrier-specific handling:** Each security barrier validates and handles specific subsystems
- **Administrator account handling:** Administrator and security personnel accounts are NOT handled by Account module; managed separately at higher security levels to prevent unauthorized access above Secondary Security Barrier

### Dynamic Token-Based Authentication
- **Variable timing:** 5-30 seconds per token
- **Single-use tokens:** Expire after one use (whichever comes first: time expiry or use)
- **Hardware-based generation:** Millisecond precision timestamps
- **Generation algorithm:** Based on system start time, random data from system, system access ID, and millisecond precision
- **Module-specific salts:** Unique per module
- **System-wide refresh:** Entire system regenerates tokens at system start
- **Caching layer:** 1-2 second cache for burst communications (reduces overhead)

### Four Security Barriers (Complete Specifications)

**Barrier Order (Top to Bottom):**
1. Special Security Barrier (highest/top)
2. Tertiary Security Barrier
3. Secondary Security Barrier
4. Primary Security Barrier (lowest/bottom - external gateway)

**Note on Numbering:** Primary Security Barrier is positioned at the bottom as the first line of defense against external threats, protecting the entire system at the entry point. The system architecture is top-down, but security barriers are numbered from entry point perspective (bottom-up), making Primary the "first" barrier users encounter, Secondary the "second," etc. This document uses top-down ordering for clarity.

**Barrier Responsibility Mapping:**
- **Special Security Barrier:** Exception - protects Special Subsystem from below (barrier to modules above it)
- **Tertiary Security Barrier:** Handles Primary subsystem (user-facing modules)
- **Secondary Security Barrier:** Handles Eternal Memory module and Secondary subsystem (11 knowledge categories)
- **Primary Security Barrier:** Exception - gateway only (protects entire system from external threats, does not handle internal subsystems)

#### 1. Special Security Barrier
**Purpose:** Absolute isolation of AI systems and development tools

**Responsibility:** Exception - acts as barrier only to modules above it (protects Special Subsystem from below)

**Connection Role:** Acts as connection point between Special Subsystem and all modules below (Core, Privilege, and lower subsystems)

**Languages:**
- **Idris 2** - Primary, dependent types for proof-carrying code

- Quantum-resistant encryption preparation
- No network references below this level
- Separate credential database
- Time-locked access (configurable)
- **Security through obscurity:** This level and above will not be listed or referenced anywhere else in the system
- **Unidirectional access:** Cannot be accessed by anything below it; can access anything below it
- **Cumulative credentials:** Requires all different levels of security credentials at and below this barrier

**Access Requirements:**
- Physical security key
- Biometric verification
- Time-based one-time password (TOTP)
- Administrator approval

- Synchronization with module generation
- Automatic lockout on mismatch
- Emergency flag system
- **Lockout behavior:**
  - Only affects upward communication
  - Downward communication continues
  - System remains functional for users
  - Admin required for upward flow restoration

**Language Module Permission:**
- **Grants permission** to Language module to override default language (System English) with Language module's English
- **Permission trigger:** Only when requested by Core module
- **Authorization flow:** Core → Tertiary Security → Language module permission granted

**Module Communication Control:**
- **Upward communication requirement:** Any module communicating from lower to higher must pass through this barrier with proper credentials
- **Credential validation:** Checks credentials for all upward-bound communication

#### 3. Secondary Security Barrier
**Purpose:** Knowledge system protection

**Responsibility:** Handles and validates access for Eternal Memory module (formerly "Master Directory") and the Secondary subsystem (11 knowledge categories)

**Languages:**
- **Rust** - Primary, memory safety without GC

**Module Communication Control:**
- **Upward communication requirement:** Any module communicating from lower to higher must pass through this barrier with proper credentials
- **Credential validation:** Checks credentials for all upward-bound communication
- **Communication pathway enforcement:** Controls passage of all inter-module communication across this boundary

**Emergency Lockout System:**
- **Automatic lockout:** If authentication mismatch detected, system locks itself out
- **Emergency flag:** Sends emergency flag explaining the issue upon lockout
- **Administrator intervention required:** No passage of communication permitted except from higher level security or administrator access modules until resolved
- **Upward communication blocked:** Lockout prevents upward communication flow
- **Downward communication maintained:** System continues normal operation for lower levels

**Virtualization Security:**
- **Complete lockout when virtualized:** Module locks up entirely in virtualized environment
- **No administrator access:** Even administrators cannot access this module when virtualized
- **Protection mechanism:** Prevents security bypass through virtualization attacks

#### 4. Primary Security Barrier
**Purpose:** Gateway protection from external threats (positioned at system entry point, below all other subsystems)

**Module Inheritance Model (CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE):**

**Strict Vertical Inheritance Rules:**
1. **Downward Only:** Modules inherit ONLY from their direct parent and ancestors in their vertical chain
2. **No Lateral Inheritance:** Siblings (e.g., Science and Commerce) CANNOT inherit from each other
3. **Branch Isolation:** Each category branch is completely isolated from other branches
4. **Ancestor Chain:** Every module automatically inherits from its entire ancestry chain up to the root

**Inheritance Chain Example:**
```
Physics Module inherits from:
- Science (parent)
- Secondary Subsystem (grandparent)
- Primary Subsystem (great-grandparent)
- Core Subsystem (root ancestor)

Physics CANNOT access:
- Commerce features
- Mathematics features (must request through proper channels)
- Belief features
- Any sibling category features
```

**Enforcement Mechanisms:**
- Registry validation prevents lateral inheritance attempts
- Communication matrix enforces branch isolation
- Security barriers act as inheritance gates
- Audit trail logs all inheritance relationships
- Void Module enforces rules during generation

**Cross-Branch Communication Rules:**
- **No direct communication** between sibling branches
- **Parent-mediated only:** Must route through common parent
- **Explicit contracts:** Data sharing requires formal protocols
- **Audited exchanges:** All cross-branch data tracked
- **Never through inheritance:** Communication ≠ inheritance

**Security Benefits of Branch Isolation:**
- **Compartmentalization:** Compromise in one branch cannot affect others
- **Clear Boundaries:** No accidental data leakage
- **Audit Clarity:** Simple, verifiable inheritance chains
- **Modular Independence:** Each category evolves independently
- **Predictable Behavior:** No unexpected lateral dependencies

**Special Subsystem Exceptions:**
- **Void Module:** Can modify any module (doesn't inherit from them)
- **Memory (AI) and Vines:** Completely isolated from lower systems
- **Override Capability:** Special Subsystem has unique inheritance rules

**Template System (Three Types):**

- System Orchestrator (startup/shutdown coordination)
- Health Monitor (continuous module health checks)
- Permission Coordinator (works with Privilege module)
- Administrative Interface (management API/CLI)
- Metrics Collector (Prometheus integration)
- Audit Logger (complete operation trail)

**Module Registration System:**

**Registration Process:**
1. Validate authorization token
2. Validate registration details (name, capabilities, dependencies)
3. Check dependencies exist
4. **Require head administrator approval** for all newly registered modules
5. Allocate resources
6. Atomic registration (prevent duplicates)
7. Update indices (name, type)
8. Persist to storage (RocksDB)
9. Notify dependent systems

**Registration Data Includes:**
- Module ID, name, version
- Module type and capabilities
- Dependencies list
- Security profile
- Communication endpoints
- Resource requirements
- Health check endpoint
- Metadata

**Deregistration Process:**
1. Validate authorization
2. Check dependent modules
3. Graceful shutdown initiation
4. Remove from registry
5. Cleanup indices
6. Release allocated resources
7. Persist changes

**Inter-Module Communication:**

**Message Router Architecture:**
- Communication channels indexed by module ID
- Message queue for async processing
- Communication matrix for authorization
- Protocol handlers for different protocols
- Rate limiting per module
- Priority-based routing (Critical, High, Normal, Low)

**Message Structure:**
- Unique ID
- Source and destination module IDs
- Payload (binary data)
- Protocol type
- Timestamp
- Priority level
- Encryption type
- Optional signature

**Routing Process:**
1. Validate source module exists
2. Check communication authorization (matrix)
3. Apply rate limiting
4. Route based on priority
5. Record metrics

**Priority Handling:**
- **Critical:** Bypass queue, force delivery if needed
- **High:** Fast-track through queue
- **Normal:** Standard queue processing
- **Low:** Background processing when capacity available

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Lock-free data structures for hot paths
- Message pools (object pooling to reduce allocations)
- SIMD operations for batch message validation (Zig)
- Ring buffer for fast message queue (Zig)
- Batch dequeue operations
- Communication matrix as bit matrix for fast lookup

- Template registered

**Visibility Rules:**
- Silently ignore modules above security level
- Only register modules visible at Core's level
- Sanitize reports sent to Void (only what Core can see)

**Synchronization Process:**
1. Get local registry state snapshot
2. Request Void state (filtered for Core's security level)
3. Compute differences
4. Apply updates
5. Update last sync timestamp

**Language Management System:**

**Dual English System (Redundancy Mechanism):**
- **System English (Core):** Fallback/backup dictionary, always available, system default
- **Standard English (Language Module):** Normal use when Language module is available and connected

**Language Manager Functions:**
- Check if Language module is available and connected
- Try to get text from Language module first (for all languages including English)
- Fall back to English dictionary if Language module unavailable or connection fails
- Parameter substitution in text templates
- Can override Language module (emergency fallback to system English)
- **Permission system:** Core grants Language module permission to handle English; if permission/connection breaks, Core's backup English takes over

**English Dictionary Contains:**
- System messages (module registration, deregistration, communication events)
- Error messages (module not found, unauthorized communication, etc.)
- UI strings (interface elements)
- Help texts (documentation)

**Override System:**
- Core can set Language module to "overridden" status
- When overridden, always use English fallback
- Can remove override to restore Language module use
- Ensures system never loses language capability even if Language module fails

**Rationale:** Redundancy system ensures critical system reliability - English language support never fails.

**Permission Orchestration:**

**Works with Privilege Module:**
- Query Privilege module for permission checks
- Apply local Core-level rules
- Cache permission results
- Audit all permission checks

**Note:** Privilege module only controls Primary Security barrier access. Core handles internal permission orchestration for subsystems above Primary Security.

**Permission Check Process:**
1. Check local cache
2. If not cached, query Privilege module
3. Apply any local override rules
4. Cache the result
5. Log the check to audit trail
6. Return permission decision

**System Orchestration:**

**Startup Sequence:**
1. Load persisted system state
2. Start core services
3. Calculate module boot order (dependency resolution)
4. Start modules in dependency order
5. Start health monitoring
6. Update system state to "Running"

**Shutdown Sequence:**
1. Update state to "Stopping"
2. Calculate shutdown order (reverse dependencies)
3. Stop modules in shutdown order
4. Stop core services
5. Save system state
6. Complete

**Module Failure Handling:**
- Detect module failure via health checks

**Language Library Management:**
- Language library updated through this module
- **Dynamic growth:** Module grows as it adds anything defined in any other module
- **Scope limitation:** Can only add to its own content, cannot modify other modules
- Continuously expanding language support

**Dual English System (Redundancy):**
- **System English (Core module):** Fallback/backup English, always available, system default
- **Standard English (Language module):** Normal use English, handled separately from system default
- **Permission-based:** Language module handles English only with permission from Core and Tertiary Security Barrier
- **Authorization flow:** Core requests → Tertiary Security Barrier grants permission → Language module authorized to override
- **Redundancy mechanism:** If Language module fails or connection breaks, Core's backup English automatically takes over
- **Scope:** Language module handles English from Eternal Memory module and down (not above it)
- **Override capability:** Core can override Language module's English if needed, returning to default English

**Rationale:** This dual system ensures the system always has English language capability even if the Language module fails, providing critical redundancy for system reliability.
